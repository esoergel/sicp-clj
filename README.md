I've been going through Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs for a while now, and also learning clojure.  I've occasionally done some of the exercises in clojure, so I'm sticking some of them in a repo.

The main impetus was for the register machine of section 5.2 - as that was a huge pain to get working, so I want source control on it for future modifications.
